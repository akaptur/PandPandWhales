Pride and Prejudice and Whales
================================

As this project stands, a general-purpose Markov-chain text generator that will produce both arbitrary-length sentences and tweet-length sentences given an input text.

To produce the tweets, it generates sentences until it finds one that is both short enough and interesting enough, given a somewhat arbitrary metric.
